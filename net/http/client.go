// A Client is an HTTP client. Its zero value (DefaultClient) is a
// usable client that uses DefaultTransport.
//
// The Client's Transport typically has internal state (cached TCP
// connections), so Clients should be reused instead of created as
// needed. Clients are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// A Client is higher-level than a RoundTripper (such as Transport)
// and additionally handles HTTP details such as cookies and
// redirects.
//
// When following redirects, the Client will forward all headers set on the
// initial Request except:
//
// • when forwarding sensitive headers like "Authorization",
// "WWW-Authenticate", and "Cookie" to untrusted targets.
// These headers will be ignored when following a redirect to a domain
// that is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain.
// For example, a redirect from "foo.com" to either "foo.com" or "sub.foo.com"
// will forward the sensitive headers, but a redirect to "bar.com" will not.
//
// • when forwarding the "Cookie" header with a non-nil cookie Jar.
// Since each redirect may mutate the state of the cookie jar,
// a redirect may possibly alter a cookie set in the initial request.
// When forwarding the "Cookie" header, any mutated cookies will be omitted,
// with the expectation that the Jar will insert those mutated cookies
// with the updated values (assuming the origin matches).
// If Jar is nil, the initial cookies are forwarded without change.

	// CheckRedirect specifies the policy for handling redirects.
	// If CheckRedirect is not nil, the client calls it before
	// following an HTTP redirect. The arguments req and via are
	// the upcoming request and the requests made already, oldest
	// first. If CheckRedirect returns an error, the Client's Get
	// method returns both the previous Response (with its Body
	// closed) and CheckRedirect's error (wrapped in a url.Error)
	// instead of issuing the Request req.
	// As a special case, if CheckRedirect returns ErrUseLastResponse,
	// then the most recent response is returned with its body
	// unclosed, along with a nil error.
	//
	// If CheckRedirect is nil, the Client uses its default policy,
	// which is to stop after 10 consecutive requests.

	// Jar specifies the cookie jar.
	//
	// The Jar is used to insert relevant cookies into every
	// outbound Request and is updated with the cookie values
	// of every inbound Response. The Jar is consulted for every
	// redirect that the Client follows.
	//
	// If Jar is nil, cookies are only sent if they are explicitly
	// set on the Request.

	// Timeout specifies a time limit for requests made by this
	// Client. The timeout includes connection time, any
	// redirects, and reading the response body. The timer remains
	// running after Get, Head, Post, or Do return and will
	// interrupt reading of the Response.Body.
	//
	// A Timeout of zero means no timeout.
	//
	// The Client cancels requests to the underlying Transport
	// as if the Request's Context ended.
	//
	// For compatibility, the Client will also use the deprecated
	// CancelRequest method on Transport if found. New
	// RoundTripper implementations should use the Request's Context
	// for cancellation instead of implementing CancelRequest.
